# Simple Password Generator in terminal

I wrote this program because I was tired of annoying pop-ups and ads, and also to practice Go.

## Install
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Usage

For create password just type 
```bash
password
```
This will create 12 characters long password with letters and digits.

Also you can use 

```bash
password --length=32 --digits=true --symbols=true
```
